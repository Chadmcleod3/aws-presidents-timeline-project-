U.S. Presidential Timeline Project

Project Goal and IT focus

The project goal was to take an existing web application codebase and successfully deploy it onto a production-ready cloud environment. 
The primary focus was on configuring the supporting cloud infrastructure and security policies not necessarily on writing the application code itself.

 Live Deployment 
The application is hosted on Amazon Web Services using a Serverless Static Architecture.
